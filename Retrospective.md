# Retrospective

## Highlights (keep doing)

Team
- Amazing
- Terrific +1
- Wonderful tag-teaming!

Challenge
- Exciting

Data
- Good learning pulling and augmenting data
- Good pipeline set up 

Other
Great Learnings
Good outputs for future projects 
1.	It is fun to work on data and AI. I have learned a lot from our discussions.
2.	We have a great team. The team worked well together and complement each other on skillsets.
Worked together really well with short time, challenging data

## Lowlights (things to change)

Planning
- Better planning
- more time would have been good
- I wish to have more time working on this ðŸ˜Š

Challenge
As this was a "kick the tires" and we had a short time, we let some ambiguity ride as we sorted it out. Next time, probably better to try to make more clarity and actionable items sooner.

Data
- Data could have been better
- Limited dataset
- Would have loved larger data set
- Wanted to learn more ai items!

Presentation
- Preso's are really, really hard (perhaps harder than the projects themselves!) How can the rest of us help as it feels like we might have put a bit of burden on those doing the preso?

## Comments
Overall, I really enjoyed the hackathon, and special thanks to all of the team members for putting in lot of effort.
