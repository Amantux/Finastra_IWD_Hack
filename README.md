 OPEN by {Default}: Build an unbiased fintech future

Join the OPEN by {Default} movement! In honor of International Women's Day 2021, Finastra’s Hack to the Future is aiming to build an unbiased fintech future. We are encouraging women-led and diverse teams to come forward and join our global open innovation community, of all genders - hacking around the clock and around the world.

FINTECH, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

For the last 15-20 years, the financial world has become increasingly reliant on the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to streamline decisioning, remain competitive and adhere to constantly changing regulation.

­This presents us with a new challenge.  Alongside unconscious bias, we now face algorithmic bias within financial services technology. This is leading to inequality when applying for finance. Meaning access to fair and equitable financial solutions, such as lending, isn’t equally available to people of all genders, races and cultures.

As the third largest fintech in the world, Finastra has decided to take a stand against bias. But we know we can’t do it alone. Join us as we work together to build an unbiased fintech future.

We invite students, fintech enthusiasts, financial institution developers and fintech founders to be a part of a movement that can have positive impact on daily lives and redefine finance for good.
